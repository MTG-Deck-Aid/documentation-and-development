# Usage of generative AI in our project

AI was used in our project to help with the development of the project.  The AI primarily used was ChatGPT, but also included copilot and gemini.  AI was used to help debug many confusing errors we encountered during debugging.  It was also used to improve/fix code that we had already coded by hand.  Finally, it was used as a source of information for understading how to use certain libraries and their methods, and the results was validated by cross referencing the AI's response with verified documentation websites.

In all, generative AI was used by our group to enchance the coding process, not do the job for us.  Any information gathered by the AI was cross referenced with reputable sources of information and between one another.
